## Design Decisions

### Wireframes
V1 ![V1 mobile and tablet](assets/images/V1%20mobile%20and%20tablet.jpg)
![V1 desktop](assets/images/V1%20desktop.jpg)

Adjusted for contact form, rule of 3, device sizes added for my ease of reference.

V2 ![V2 mobile and tablet](assets/images/V2%20mobile%20and%20tablet.jpg)
![V2 desktop](assets/images/V2%20desktop.jpg)

Note: final structure altered considerably.

### Accessibility

Images : will have alt text. ** I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ADD ALT TEXT TO BACKGROUND IMAGES**

Bootstrap code : has built in aria labels.

Colour palette: Initially I had a logo - see above - and matched the colour scheme to that using the pippete on the colour picker. However I have not used the logo as yet on the page so I have chosen a bold palette to match the rainbow theme of the LGBT+++ movement.To contrast text better I toned doen the initial choices of colours and increased the font weight. Text colour is black.

## Testing and Validation

All links tested and shown to be working in gitpod environment and on deployed site.

#### Validation

HTML validated using [markup validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
The following results have been found ![html-test](assets/images/html-test.JPG)
Both relate to p elements - extra closing tags. I have rectified by targetting div classes. 
![css-text](assets/images/html-test-repeat.JPG)

CSS validated using [css validator](assets/images/css-test.JPG)
All css validated but I do believe I have a lot of unnecessary css. If time allows I will review it.
