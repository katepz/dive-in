## Design Decisions

### Wireframes
V1 ![V1 mobile and tablet](assets/images/V1%20mobile%20and%20tablet.jpg)
![V1 desktop](assets/images/V1%20desktop.jpg)

Adjusted for contact form, rule of 3, device sizes added for my ease of reference.

V2 ![V2 mobile and tablet](assets/images/V2%20mobile%20and%20tablet.jpg)
![V2 desktop](assets/images/V2%20desktop.jpg)

Note: final structure altered considerably.

### Accessibility

Images : will have alt text. ** I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ADD ALT TEXT TO BACKGROUND IMAGES**

Bootstrap code : has built in aria labels.

Colour palette: Initially I had a logo - see above - and matched the colour scheme to that using the pippete on the colour picker. However I have not used the logo as yet on the page so I have chosen a bold palette to match the rainbow theme of the LGBT+++ movement.To contrast text better I toned doen the initial choices of colours and increased the font weight. Text colour is black.

Colour and Background in jumbotron: adjusted for better viewing.

## Features Implementation

### Optional Features

Are not included at this time.

## Testing and Validation

#### Testing
All links tested and shown to be working in gitpod environment and on deployed site.

#### Validation

HTML validated using [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
The following results have been found ![html-test](assets/images/html-test.JPG)
Both relate to p elements - extra closing tags. I have rectified by targetting div classes. 
![css-text](assets/images/html-test-repeat.JPG)


CSS validated using [The W3C CSS Validation Service](assets/images/css-test.JPG)
All css validated but I do believe I have a lot of unnecessary css. If time allows I will review it.

## Reflection on the Development Process

### Successes

I have made a website from scratch for the first time.

I have met all the Learning Outcomes for the project.

I have fixed many of the issues I encountered by myself using research, with help from my cohort and with help from a coding coach.

I have a clearer idea of how I would tackle a similar project in the future based on my experience completing this project.

### Challenges

##### Planning
I found the planning process straightforward at the time but as I progressed through I realised that my planning was inadequate. This made it harder to stick to an overall vision and when needing help it was difficult to reference what I was asking for. 

I used powerpoint to produce basic wireframe diagrams, I revised these early on but they do not reflect the final product.

Visual effects are difficult for me and so colour palette was not something I thought much about beforehand aprt from after creating my logo.

#### Implementation
My work lacked structure. I spent the first 2 days feeling like a rabbit in the headlights. Although elements were in place and all links worked, my page was a mess. I found positioning very difficult and the use of images other than as backgrounds was a real issue for me. 

In the evening of day 2 I was more systematic. I replaced features that I had added with Bootstrap features. This made the page more presentable. I had an issue with the functionality of the Bootstrap navbar toggle menu. One of my chort made a suggestion that worked - I had added the wrong Bootstrap js script.


### Final Thoughts
Overall I have found this a very enlightening process. I have learned so much in 4 weeks but realise that I have only a passing knowledge of those things and need to put in some extra time on consolidating the html and css, including Bootstrap. Use of balsamiq for wireframing will also be on the hit list.






## Code Attribution and Credits
I have used Bootstrap v4.6 to add features to my website.

## Future Improvements

There are many things I would like to change on this project going forward including but not limited to:

- colour palette
- layout of information
- use of images other than as backgrounds
- positioning of elements 
- structure and presentation of the footer

## Just In Case

In case anyone reads through to this point I thought I would tell my favourite one-liner as a reward  for what may have been a painful process!

Q: Where would you find a tortoise with no legs?

A: Where you left it
